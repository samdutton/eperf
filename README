Run Lighthouse audits on multiple sites defined in the file _input.csv_.

Each line in _input.csv_ begins with a URL, optionally followed by other comma-separated data for the URL. 

For example: `https://johnlewis.com,John Lewis,homepage`.

Results are written to _output.csv_ with one line per URL. Each line begins with audit scores for performance, PWA, accessibility, best practices and SEO, followed by the URL and then other data. 

For example: `0.50,0.38,0.78,0.87,1,https://johnlewis.com,John Lewis,homepage`
